### Volumes

#### warehouse base storage(surely need to be changed later): 10000 
@ Leon: Please hardcode and remove possibility to set in constructor.

@ All: Adjust constructors of warehouse where you used them :P
####Resources (Volume):
* wood        = 10 
* insulation  = 20 
* brick       = 10
* window      = 10
* concrete    = 5
* roof tile   = 1

#####Walls (Volume, can be hard coded, no calculation needed):
light weight conctruction = 50 + 20 + 10 = 80

light weight plus construction = 50 + 60 + 10 = 120

massive light construction = 40 + 20 + 10 = 80

massive plus construction = 40 + 100 + 10 + 5 = 155

panorama wall = 16 + 50 + 5 + 60 = 131
